# PID-Controlled-Two-Wheeled-Self-Balancing-Robot

 The robot represents a unique solution to the well understood problem of control of a two wheeled inverted pendulum.
The source code  constitutes the robot's balance control logic. The controller comes with a handy Gazebo simulation which was used extensively during the development 
of the robot. The source code is being provided as open-source software in order to help others learn about feedback 
control and the Robot Operating System (ROS).
